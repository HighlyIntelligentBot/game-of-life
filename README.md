# Comways Game of Life
My version of John Comways "Game Of Life", written completely object oriented.

Tkinter is used for the graphics

To launch, simply run game.py

By adjusting the arguments of App(), you can change the screen- and cell-size.

TODO: 

      Make the Board clickable

      Let game.py take sys arguments to adjust screen- and cell-size
      
      Implement third colour for cells that recently died
