# Comways Game of Life
My version of John Comways "Game Of Life", written completely object oriented.

Tkinter is used for the graphics

To launch, simply run game.py. You can use command line arguments to set the screen size and cell size:

The first argument is the screen width, the second is the screen height and the third one is the cell size. Example:

      ~$ game.py 1000 1000 50

This runs the app with a resolution of 1000x1000 and a cell size of 50.

The default values are 800x800 with a cell size of 50.


TODO:
